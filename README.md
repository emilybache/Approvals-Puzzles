Approvals Puzzles
=================

This project contains some folders. Each folder contains
a python program. 

* Try out each program to see what it does. All of them can be run on the command line like this:
    
    `python3 filename.py`
     
* If the program needs input, come up with something suitable. 
* Look at the output the program produces. Could you use it in an approval test?
* What challenges would there be with this program for Approval testing?
* Would a different testing approach be better?
